The Problem:

Write a program that reads input from a file in a specific format, regarding all your friends' names and phone numbers.
Your program should store that information and analyze it in some way. For example, you can show the user where their
friends live based on the area code of the phone numbers, and the number of states where they live.

read_file function will assume the data is in the following format:

Friend 1 name
Friend 1 phone number
Friend 2 name
Friend 2 phone number
<and so on>

** because each piece of information is on a separate line, your program will have a newline character as the final
   character of each line

You can have Python read the file and store every other line in a tuple, starting with the first (group all names
together), then read every other line, starting with the second, and store as another tuple for the phone numbers.

** to remove \n from a string, use the following:

word = "bird\n"
print(word)
word = word.replace("\n", "") # This replaces the newline character with nothing
print(word)

** alternative to word.replace() is word.strip("\n")
