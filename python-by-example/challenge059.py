# Display five colours and ask the user to pick one. If they pick the same
# as the program has chosen, say "Well done", otherwise display a witty
# answer which involves the correct colour, e.g. "I bet you are GREEN
# with envy" or "You are probably feeling BLUE right now". Ask them to
# guess again; if they have still not got it right, keep giving them
# the same clue and ask the user to enter a colour until they guess it
# correctly.
