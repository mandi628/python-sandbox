# Ask which direction the user wants to count (up or down). If they select up, then ask
# then for the top number and then count from 1 to that number. If they select down, 
# ask them to enter a number below 20 and then count down from 20 to that number. If they
# entered something other than up or down, display the message "I don't understand."
